# Trace 1: HTTP
## Give three websites (domain Nname and IP addresses) visited from source IP address `192.168.0.100`
http://205.251.242.54/ - https://www.amazon.com
http://69.16.143.26/ - http://www.bing.com
http://50.93.210.4/ - http://www.madisonproperty.com

## Give three search queries and the domain of the site for each query made from source IP address `192.168.0.100`
https://www.bing.com was searched for "madison map"
http://www.amazon.com was search for "adventures in Stochastic Processes"
http://www.baidu.com was searched for "My Love from the Star" (but in Chinese)


# Trace 2: FTP
## What is the user name and password used to connect to the FTP server?
username: shiningmoon
password: public

## List any (and all) files that were downloaded.
There were four files:
	ARP.java
	L2Switch.java
	dragon.zip
	phase1.html


## List the full path for two files (in different directories) on the FTP server that were NOT downloaded.
	/phase1/StoreForwardingDataLink.java
	/jerry5tests.zip

# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.
	The traceroute tool is used to find the path of IP addresses used to get from the host machine (that issued the 
	traceroute request) to the destination IP address. To do this User Datagram Protocol is used to send packets to the next
	device along the path. The initial packet will have a Time-To-Live (TTL) value of 1, which gets decremented for each
	IP address passed through from host to destination. When the TTL value reaches zero the current IP address in the path will
	send an ICMP echo back to the host saying TTL value  exceeded. For this initial packet that means it will tell us the 
	first device in our path form host to destination. Traceroute will then send out another UDP packet with TTL value 2, which
	will find the second IP address in the path. The next UDP packet will have a TTL value of 3, and this pattern continues 
	until the destination is reached, giving the host an entire list of IP addresses passed through to get to 
	the destination. 
	
	***Also, I don't know if this is the same across all OS's but in OS X it appears that traceroute will actually send out three
	packets in a row with the same TTL value, meaning they would get the first IP address three times in a row, followed by the
	second IP address three times in a row, etc. I assume this is done incase a random packet gets dropped.


## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.
	Source: 192.168.0.100
	Destination: 74.125.225.46

## List the IP addresses on the route between source and destination.
	Host: 192.168.0.100
	192.168.0.1 (I assume this is the router for the users home network)
	10.131.180.1
	96.34.20.20
	96.34.17.95
	96.34.16.112
	96.34.2.4
	96.34.0.7
	96.34.0.9
	96.34.3.9
	96.34.152.30
	209.85.254.120
	209.85.250.28
	Destination: 74.125.225.46


# Trace 4: POP
## What is the POP username and password?
	username: cs155@dummymail.com
	password: whitehat

## How many emails are in the userâ€™s mailbox?
	5

## Give the contents of from, to, subject, and date for one email message.
	One of the emails is from harinym@stanford.edu and is being sent to cs155@dummymail.com. The subject is 'wassup' and it was sent
	on Friday, April 23rd 2010 at 08:21:51
	
	The content is "pop is cool".

## What email client (application) and operating system is this person using to send and receive email?
